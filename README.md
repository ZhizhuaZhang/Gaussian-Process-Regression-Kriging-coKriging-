# Gaussian-Process-Regression-Kriging-coKriging-
This matlab toolbox contains all the necessary codes for experimental design methods. 
Functions of Gaussian Process Regression(GPR) (also known as Kriging) as well as multi-fidelity GPR (co-Kriging) are also present.
The genetic algorithm used for global optimization in different codes is from yarpiz.com
